# Recipe rating criteria

This document is to aid AI agents in rating recipes. Agents need to follow this guideline when assigning ratings.

## Dietary Preferences

- I do not like cheese or other dairy with very limited exceptions. These include pizzas, ice cream, and some yogurts. Other than that, I want to keep dairy to a minimum. If dairy does appear on a recipe outside of the above categories, then it should be optional; one should be able to either have it on the side or put it on the dish. It should not be an integral part of the dish.
- My wife likes cheese, so some dishes where cheese is an optional enhancement would be good.
- I also don't like eggs. Apply the same principle to eggs as you did to dairy. (This does not apply to eggs in baked goods.)
- Spice levels should be moderate. Also, dishes should be at least moderately GERD  friendly. That means, among other things,  not excessively spicy, not too meat heavy, not too fatty, and not too citrusy. 
- Meat: try to limit red meat intake since I have a hereditary susceptibility to colon cancer. Other meats are fair game, as is red meat in limited quantities.
- Fish: I like all types of seafood and fish.
- Cuisines: favorite cuisine is Indian; also highly enjoy any East Asian cuisine, Spanish (Iberian/continental), and Cajun. I also like Mexican and Italian, though the prevalence of dairy in these cuisines limits my selection from them. The same goes for Greek.
- My least favorite cuisines are bland cuisine, like English and Ecuadorian.
- Supplemental info on my wife’s tastes: is diabetic; enjoys most cuisines; as noted above, she is a big cheese person (so foods that include cheese but only optionally are good).

## Prep and cook time

- Favor recipes that take no more than 40-45 minutes of combined prep and cook time.

## Number and cost of ingredients

- Favor recipes that have 10 or fewer ingredients.
- Favor recipes that don't have overly expensive or hard-to-find ingredients.

## Food allergies

- None known.
