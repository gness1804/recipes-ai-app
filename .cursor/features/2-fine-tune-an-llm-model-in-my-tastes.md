# Fine Tune An Llm Model In My Tastes

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/pinecone/recipes-ai-app`

## Contents
This recipe chatbot should be fine-tuned in my taste. The way that I will do this is I will take a base model such as GPT-4.1 and I will fine-tune it with recipes taken off the internet. For each recipe taken off the internet, I will give it a ranking of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, and then I will explain why I like it and why I don't. With enough examples, this should teach the model what kind of stuff that I like. And so future recipes that it recommends should only be ones that accord to my taste.

## Acceptance criteria
- An application based on a fine-tuned model trained on my tastes.
- The application should be able to recommend recipes based on my tastes.
- The application should be able to provide explanations for its recommendations.
- The application should be able to handle user feedback and adjust its recommendations accordingly.
