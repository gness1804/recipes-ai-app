# Rate The Recipes

## Working directory

`~/Desktop/pinecone/recipes-ai-app`

## Contents

Now that I've added all the recipes to my list, for the MVP anyway, I need to rate them. It's a tedious process, but I wanted to go into all of the recipes and add a 1-10 rating for them. That will help the LLM later to understand the recipes. 

## Acceptance criteria

- All recipes shall have a 1-10 rating. 
- Be the possibility of a rating such as "N" which would signify that I have not yet tried the recipe. If so, I might need to upgrade the logic in the transform recipe script to accommodate that.
