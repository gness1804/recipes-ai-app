This should be derived from the title of the recipe, not the contents.\n        For example, \"caribbean-chicken\" for the recipe \"Caribbean Chicken\".\n    \"#)\n    content string @description(#\"\n        The full recipe content. This is the full recipe content, including the title, ingredients, instructions, and other information.\n    \"#)\n    title string @description(#\"\n        The title of the recipe.\n    \"#)\n    ingredients string @description(#\"\n        The ingredients of the recipe. This is the ingredients section of the recipe. It should be presented as a single string with a numbered list in it. For example:\n        ```\n        1. 1 cup of flour\n        2. 2 cups of sugar\n        3. 3 cups of milk\n        ```\n    \"#)\n    instructions string @description(#\"\n        The instructions of the recipe.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n        2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and milk.\n        3. Pour the mixture into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\n        4.

This is a float between 1.0 and 10.0. Return null only if you truly cannot evaluate the recipe.\n\n        RATING CRITERIA (rate based on how well the recipe fits these preferences):\n\n        Dietary Preferences:\n        - Avoid dairy (cheese, milk, cream) except in: pizza, ice cream, some yogurts. Dairy should be optional/on-the-side, not integral.\n        - Avoid eggs as a main component (eggs in baked goods are fine).\n        - Moderate spice levels preferred. Should be GERD-friendly: not too spicy, not too fatty, not too citrusy, not too meat-heavy.\n        - Limit red meat (hereditary colon cancer susceptibility). Other meats and seafood are good.\n        - Seafood/fish: all types are enjoyed.\n\n        Cuisine Preferences (favor these):\n        - Favorites: Indian, East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai), Spanish/Iberian, Cajun\n        - Also liked: Mexican, Italian (but dairy limits selection)\n        - Least favorite: bland cuisines (English, Ecuadorian)\n\n        Practical Considerations:\n        - Favor recipes with 40-45 minutes or less total prep+cook time\n        - Favor recipes with 10 or fewer ingredients\n        - Favor recipes without expensive or hard-to-find ingredients\n\n        Scoring guidance:\n        - 8-10: Excellent fit (preferred cuisine, no dietary issues, quick/easy)\n        - 6-7: Good fit (minor issues or neutral cuisine)\n        - 4-5: Acceptable but has drawbacks (contains dairy/eggs as optional, longer prep, etc.)\n        - 1-3: Poor fit (integral dairy/eggs, very fatty/spicy, bland cuisine, excessive red meat)\n    \"#)\n    diet string[] @description(#\"\n        The diet of the recipe. This is an array of strings. The possible values are: vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, dairy-free, gluten-free. You may add new values if the recipe clearly fits a dietary category not listed (e.g., \"keto\", \"paleo\").\n    \"#)\n    protein string[] @description(#\"\n        The protein of the recipe. This is an array of strings. The possible values are: beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey, seafood, tofu, egg, none. \n        \"seafood\" covers fish, shrimp, clams, etc.\n        Use \"none\" for recipes with no significant protein source\n        A recipe can have multiple proteins (e.g., jambalaya with [\"chicken\", \"seafood\", \"pork\"])\n        You may add new values if needed (e.g., \"duck\", \"game\")\n    \"#)\n    cuisine string[] @description(#\"\n        The cuisine of the recipe. This is an array of strings. The possible values are: american, cajun, caribbean, chinese, cuban, indian, italian, japanese, korean, mexican, thai, african, brazilian, mediterranean, other. Use \"other\" sparingly - prefer adding a specific cuisine if identifiable. A recipe can blend cuisines (e.g., [\"thai\", \"chinese\"] for a fusion dish). You may add new values if needed (e.g., \"indonesian\", \"vietnamese\", \"spanish\"). Only use \"other\" if you truly cannot identify the national or ethnic origin of the recipe.\n    \"#)\n    meal_type string[] @description(#\"\n        The meal type of the recipe. This is an array of strings. The possible values are: main-dish, side-dish, dessert, sauce, soup, salad, breakfast, snack. A recipe can be multiple types (e.g., a substantial salad could be [\"salad\", \"main-dish\"]). You may add new values if needed (e.g., \"appetizer\", \"beverage\", \"condiment\").\n    \"#)\n    difficulty string @description(#\"\n        The difficulty of the recipe. The possible values are: easy, medium, hard. Unlike with some of the other categories, this is mutually exclusive.\n        easy: Few ingredients, simple techniques, under 30 mins active time\n        medium: More ingredients or techniques, 30-60 mins active time\n        hard: Complex techniques, many steps, over 60 mins active time, or requires special skills\n        You may add new values if needed (e.g., \"expert\", \"advanced\")\n    \"#)\n    prepTimeMinutes int @description(#\"\n        The preparation and cooking time of the recipe in minutes. Estimate based on the instructions. Include both prep time and cooking/baking time.
