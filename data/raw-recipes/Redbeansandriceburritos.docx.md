Red beans and rice burritos

Inspired by the meal we ate on the backpacking trip in September 2019\.

2 avocados, cut into small slices  
1 box Red beans and rice \- Zatarains  
1 jar salsa  
10 tortillas \- burrito sized  
Optional: corn, green peppers, other veggies

Start by putting together all the ingredients of the rice and beans mixtures and turning on the heat.

Cut up avocado into small slices.

Prepare any other veggies and place into small bowls.

Cook red beans and rice according to package instructions. Make sure most of the water has been cooked down.

Heat up 2-3 tortillas.

Add red beans and rice plus all veggies to the tortillas and serve.
