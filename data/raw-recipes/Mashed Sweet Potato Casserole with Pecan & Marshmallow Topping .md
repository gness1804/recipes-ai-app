Mashed Sweet Potato Casserole with Pecan & Marshmallow Topping

Ingredients:

	•	4 pounds sweet potatoes (about 6 large ones)  
	•	1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the dish  
	•	1/4 cup brown sugar  
	•	1/4 cup pure maple syrup  
	•	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
	•	1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
	•	1/4 cup heavy cream or whole milk  
	•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
	•	Salt to taste  
	•	1 cup pecans, chopped  
	•	1-2 cups mini marshmallows

Instructions:

**To do the night before:**

	1\.	Preheat Oven and Prepare Sweet Potatoes:  
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pierce the sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake until they are soft, about 1 hour. Remove them from the oven and let cool slightly.  
	2\.	Mash the Sweet Potatoes:  
When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and place the flesh in a large mixing bowl. Then put the peeled potatoes in the fridge overnight.

**To do the day of:**

1. Add the butter and mash the potatoes until they’re smooth. You can use a potato masher or hand mixer to get a creamier consistency.  
2. Season the Mixture: Stir in the brown sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, heavy cream, and vanilla extract into the mashed sweet potatoes. Season with salt to your taste.  
3. Prepare the Baking Dish: Butter a medium-size baking dish. Transfer the sweet potato mixture to the dish, smoothing the top with a spatula.  
4. Add Pecans: In a small bowl, mix the chopped pecans with a bit of butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar if desired for extra crunch and sweetness. Sprinkle this mixture over the mashed sweet potatoes.  
5. Top with Marshmallows: Arrange the mini marshmallows over the top of the pecans, covering the surface.  
6. Bake the Casserole: Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes (at the same temperature of 375°F (190°C)), or until the marshmallows are golden brown and puffy. Keep a close eye on it towards the end to prevent the marshmallows from burning.  
7. Serve Warm: Let the casserole sit for a few minutes after taking it out of the oven; this will allow the topping to set slightly. Serve warm as a delightful side that offers the perfect balance of savory-sweet flavors and a variety of textures from the creamy sweet potatoes to the crunchy pecans and gooey marshmallows.
