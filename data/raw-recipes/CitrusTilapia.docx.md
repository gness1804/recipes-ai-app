Citrus Tilapia

Turned out very well\!

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
1 pound tilapia fillets  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1 tablespoon butter (not needed)  
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice or high-quality store-bought orange juice  
1 lemon, zested and juiced  
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

1\. On a plate, combine the flour and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Lightly dredge the tilapia in the flour.

2\. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil and butter. When the butter has melted, add the fish and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden and just cooked through. Remove the fish and set aside.

3\. Add the orange juice, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, and the ginger to the skillet. Increase the heat and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Taste and add lemon zest or more lemon juice if necessary. Return the fish to the skillet, coat with sauce, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until heated through.
