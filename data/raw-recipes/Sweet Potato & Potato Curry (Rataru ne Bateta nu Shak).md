### **Sweet Potato & Potato Curry (Rataru ne Bateta nu Shak)**

This Gujarati‑style curry combines cubes of sweet potato and regular potato simmered with tomatoes and spices. It’s naturally vegan and GERD‑friendly (the single dried chilli is optional, so you can dial back the heat). Prep takes about 10 minutes and cook time is roughly 20 minutes—perfect for a weeknight dinner.

Overall opinion: turned out just so-so. Part of it is confusion in the instructions as generated by ChatGPT. I corrected this. It just turned out pretty dry. If I make it again, I would probably need to use at least one more cup of water later in the cooking process, and maybe read some spices near the end.

#### **Ingredients**

* 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed

* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed

* 1 cup crushed tomatoes (canned or fresh)

* 3–4 cloves garlic, crushed

* 1 tsp mustard seeds

* 1 dried red chilli (optional)

* 1 tsp turmeric powder

* 1 tsp ground cumin‑coriander (dhana jiru)

* 1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)

* 1 tsp chilli powder (use less or omit for mild heat)

* 2 tsp lemon juice

* 2 tsp tamarind sauce (optional)

* 2 tsp jaggery or brown sugar

* 3 Tbsp sunflower oil (or olive/other neutral oil)

#### **Method**

1. **Prep the vegetables.** Peel and cube the sweet potato and potatoes; rinse them in cold water.

2. **Bloom the spices.** Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and add the dried chilli and mustard seeds until the seeds pop.

3. **Cook the potatoes.** Add the cubed potatoes to the pan with salt, turmeric, chilli powder and cumin‑coriander. Add the crushed garlic and stir so the spices coat the potatoes. Pour in 1 cup of water and simmer until the potatoes start to soften.

4. **Add sweet potatoes.** Add the cubed sweet potatoes (they cook faster than regular potatoes) and continue cooking gently until both types of potato are tender but not mushy.

5. **Add acidity and sweetness.** Stir in crushed tomatoes, lemon juice, tamarind (if using) and jaggery/brown sugar. Cook a couple more minutes so the flavors meld.

6. **Serve.** Adjust seasoning, garnish with fresh cilantro if you have it, and serve hot with naan, roti or steamed rice. The curry is flavorful on its own, but your wife could sprinkle cheese on her portion if desired since cheese isn’t integral to the dish.
