# **Turkey & Cabbage Rice-Noodle Stir-Fry**

* **Time:** \~10 min prep, \~15–18 min cook (note, 10 minutes of prep is unrealistic. More like 20 minutes.)

* **Serves:** 4

* **Why it fits:** Lean poultry, lots of veg, gentle aromatics, heat on the side; weeknight fast.

Overall impression: Decent. It was a passable meal at the first dinner, but it doesn't make a good leftover.
