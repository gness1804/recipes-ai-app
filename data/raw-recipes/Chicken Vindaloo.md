### **Total ingredients: 20**

### **Total steps: 2**

### **Ingredients:**

1. 1 teaspoon ground turmeric  
2. ½ teaspoon ground cardamom  
3. ½ tablespoon ground cinnamon  
4. ½ teaspoon ground coriander  
5. ½ teaspoon ground cloves  
6. ½ teaspoon ground cumin  
7. ½ teaspoon paprika  
8. ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste  
9. 1 tablespoon olive oil  
10. 2 cups chopped onion  
11. 3 cloves garlic, minced  
12. 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root  
13. 1 tablespoon tomato paste  
14. 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces  
15. 2 large potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes  
16. 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained  
17. 1 ½ cups chicken broth  
18. 2 tablespoons wine vinegar  
19. 1 bay leaf  
20. salt and black pepper to taste

### **Steps:**

1. Toast the turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-low heat until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir the spices constantly as they toast, taking care that they do not burn. Stir in the olive oil, onion, garlic, and ginger. Increase heat to medium, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  
2. Stir in the tomato paste until no lumps of paste remain. Add the chicken, potatoes, tomatoes, chicken broth, wine vinegar, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Remove the cover, and cook 5 minutes more to thicken slightly. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to serve.
