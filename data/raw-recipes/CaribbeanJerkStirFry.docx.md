Caribbean Jerk Stir-Fry

1 cup rice or quinoa  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 green bell pepper, seeded and cubed  
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cubed  
1/4 cup sliced sweet onions  
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips (560 cal, 100 g protein, 16g fat)  
2 1/2 teaspoons Caribbean jerk seasoning  
1/2 cup plum sauce  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts (320 cal, 16 g protein, 28 g fat)  
(Total: 880 cal, 116g protein, 44 g fat)

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the bell pepper and onion in the oil until slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pepper and onion from the skillet and set aside. Add the chicken to the skillet; season with jerk seasoning; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink inside. Pour the plum sauce in with the chicken; add the bell peppers and onions; toss to combine. Cook until the peppers and onions are heated completely, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with soy sauce and chopped peanuts to serve.
