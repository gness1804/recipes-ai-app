### **Total steps: 3**

### **Ingredients:**

1. ¼ cup plain yogurt  
2. ¼ cup lemon juice  
3. ¼ cup canola oil  
4. 3 tablespoons white vinegar  
5. 4 cloves garlic, crushed  
6. 1 teaspoon salt  
7. 1 teaspoon smoked paprika  
8. 1 teaspoon ground cumin  
9. 1 teaspoon dried oregano  
10. 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced  
11. 2 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed

### **Steps:**

1. Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 1/4 cup oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, paprika, cumin, and oregano in a large glass or ceramic bowl; mix well. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.  
2. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.  
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil in batches until tender and browned, about 5 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
