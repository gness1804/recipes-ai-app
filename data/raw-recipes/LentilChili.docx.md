Bring broth and water to a boil in a 4½-quart Dutch oven or soup pot. Meanwhile, pick through lentils checking for stones or debris. Rinse lentils and drain. When broth boils, add lentils, and bring broth mixture back to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and cook at a very slow boil, covered (crack lid to vent if pot threatens to boil over), for 20 minutes.

Add tomatoes with juice to pot. Peel and coarsely chop onion, and add to pot. Seed and coarsely chop green peppers, and add to pot. Add garlic. Add tomato paste, ketchup, chili powder, cumin, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Stir to mix well. Simmer 15 minutes, covered, stirring frequently. Add a little more water or vegetable stock if all moisture evaporates.

Remove pan from heat. Stir in olive oil and vinegar. Add hot pepper sauce to taste, if desired. Serve at once, topped with cheese and sour cream, if desired.
