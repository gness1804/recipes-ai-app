CRISPY SWEET POTATO FRIES

1 tsp. kosher salt  
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper  
1/2 tsp. garlic powder

In bowl, combine salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and cinnamon. Halve each potato lengthwise. Slice into 1/4" sticks. In lg pot, heat oil. In batches, cook fries in oil for 5 minutes or until crisp (about 8 min in my experience). Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with cayenne mix over fries.
