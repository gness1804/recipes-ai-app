**Easy Cajun Shrimp**

*Source: Found online ([Healthy Fitness Meals](https://healthyfitnessmeals.com/cajun-shrimp-recipe/))*

This quick Cajun shrimp recipe hits the spot for both of you: shrimp is lean, the Cajun spice can be dialed up or down for heat, and the dish is naturally dairy-free (unless you want to add a little cheese on top for Sarah). Serve it over rice or cauliflower rice for a filling, diabetic-friendly meal. You can skip the rice or use brown rice/quinoa for lower carbs.

**Ingredients (serves 2, double for more):**

* 1 lb large shrimp, peeled & deveined, tail off

* 2 tbsp olive oil

* 2 tbsp Cajun seasoning (reduce for milder spice)

* Kosher salt & pepper (to taste)

* Lime wedges, for garnish

* Fresh parsley or cilantro, for garnish

* Cooked jasmine rice or Cajun rice

**Instructions:**

1. Toss shrimp with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper.

2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add shrimp and cook 2-3 min per side, until pink and opaque.

3. Serve over rice or cauliflower rice. Garnish with lime and parsley/cilantro.
