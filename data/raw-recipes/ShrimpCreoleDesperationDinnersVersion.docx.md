http://kitchenscoop.com/recipes/beverlys-shrimp-creole

1-2 cups brown rice (1 cup: 300 cal, 6g protein, 3g fat)  
1 teaspoon olive oil (40 cal, 5g fat)  
1 large onion, chopped  
2 medium ribs celery, chopped  
1 medium green bell pepper, chopped  
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (or soy sauce)  
2 clove fresh garlic, minced or 2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic  
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay (or Cajun seasoning)  
1 bay leaf  
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
1 dash Tabasco sauce, or more to taste  
1 can diced tomatoes, seasoned with onions and garlic  
1 small can (8 ounces) tomato sauce  
1 pound already-cooked, already-peeled shrimp, fresh or frozen (480 cal, 93g protein, 8g fat)  
Total: 820 cal, 100g protein, 16g fat)

1\. Heat the oil over medium heat in a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Add the onion, celery and bell pepper. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables begin to get tender, about 2 minutes. While the vegetables cook, begin adding the Worcestershire sauce, garlic, Cajun seasoning, bay leaf, thyme, black pepper, and Tabasco sauce.

2\. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the tomato sauce, and stir well. Raise the heat to medium-high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Meanwhile, continue adding the remaining spices. Continue to cook the sauce at a moderate boil for 2 minutes to blend the flavors.

3\. Stir in the shrimp, and cook, stirring frequently, until they are heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes if the shrimp are frozen, and about 2 minutes if not frozen. Taste the sauce, and add more Tabasco sauce if desired. Serve at once over hot, cooked rice, if desired.
