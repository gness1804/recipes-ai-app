2 ½ cups "instant" (5-minute) rice  
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 1 ⅓ pounds), fresh or frozen  
Spicy Peanut Sauce (recipe follows)  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 tablespoon bottled minced garlic  
1 tablespoon bottled chopped ginger  
1 to 2 bunches scallions (green onions; for ¾ cup chopped)  
1 can (8 ounces) sliced bamboo shoots  
⅓ cup unsalted peanuts  
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce  
1 tablespoon dry sherry  
1 teaspoon sugar

Spicy Peanut Sauce Ingredients:

½ tablespoons creamy peanut butter  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce  
2 tablespoons sugar  
2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar or distilled white vinegar  
1 ½ teaspoon dark sesame oil  
⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (see Box)

Instructions:

Main dish instructions:  
Bring 2 ½ cups of water to a boil. Add the rice, cover, and remove from heat.  
Defrost frozen chicken in the microwave for 2 minutes on high; meanwhile, make the Spicy Peanut Sauce (see below).  
Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat. Cut the chicken into short strips about 1 ½ inch wide, adding them to the skillet as you cut.  
Add the garlic and ginger and cook until the chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently.  
While the chicken cooks, cut the scallions into ¾-inch slices, using the white and enough of the tender green tops to make ¾ cup; drain the bamboo shoots, and chop the peanuts. Set each aside.  
When the chicken is no longer pink, add the scallions, bamboo shoots, peanuts, soy sauce, sherry, and sugar. Stir well, then add the Peanut Sauce and stir well again.  
Cook until heated through, 2 minutes. Serve over a bed of the rice.

Spicy peanut sauce instructions:  
The Spicy Peanut Sauce is made by combining all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisking until well combined. This makes about ½ cup and could also be a good dipping sauce for grilled chicken or pork. The level of spicy heat can be controlled by adding or deleting the ground cayenne pepper, or by adding crushed hot red pepper for more heat.
