Verdict: good, but ingredient-intensive. It takes a little while to cook. I would give the finished recipe 4 out of 5 stars.

2 tablespoons canola oil (240 cal, 0g protein, 28g fat)

1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste  
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
1 (14-ounce) can light coconut milk (239 cal, 5.3g protein, 21.3g fat)

In a medium stockpot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and chili; cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add the broth, chickpeas, tomatoes, curry powder, salt, and black pepper; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer gently, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.
