Verdict: excellent. It turned out very well. I didn't have lime juice, but it still turned out delicious. No need to heat it. I just spread it on noodles, and it was very good. I needed maybe half of the quarter cup of water that they recommend to get just the right consistency.

### **INSTRUCTIONS**

###  

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, lime juice, and red pepper flakes.  
2. Gradually add water or coconut milk, a little at a time, whisking until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. If you want to spread or dip it, add less water/milk, and for drizzling, add more water/milk.  
3. Taste the sauce and adjust the flavors if needed, adding more lime juice, soy sauce, or red pepper flakes to suit your taste.  
4. Use immediately as a dip, drizzle, or toss with noodles. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
