0\. Blend above spices in a bowl and set aside. Prep all relevant ingredients by chopping, etc. 1\. Heat the olive oil in a large pot (the jambalaya pot) and sauté the onion for 3 minutes or until translucent. Then saute all peppers. 2 Add the rice and sauté for a further 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure the rice doesn't stick. 3 Add the vegetable stock, clam juice, and about a third of the spices. Simmer for 20 minutes or until all but a little bit of the liquid has been absorbed. 4 Stir in the peas and tomatoes. 4.5 Add the seafood. 5 Add artichoke hearts and lemon juice to the pan. 5.5 Add the rest of the spices. Mix in well. 6 Continue cooking until the rice is tender, topping up with additional hot water if needed. 7 Serve the paella with lemon wedges to garnish.
