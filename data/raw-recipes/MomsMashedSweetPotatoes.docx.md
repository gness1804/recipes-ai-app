Mom's Mashed Sweet Potatoes

Ingredients:

3 T Brown sugar (double: 6T)

1/4 cup Butter (double: ½ cup)

A few Marshmallows

2 Sweet Potatoes (double: 4\)

Steps:

Bake sweet potatoes at 350 for 40 minutes. (Put aluminum foil on the row underneath the sweet potatoes in the oven so the juices don't fall to the bottom of the oven.)   
\* The cook time may need to be adjusted depending on the number and size of sweet potatoes. If they still are not done after about an hour or so, increase the temperature to 400\. 

Poke the sweet potatoes with a fork to see if they're done. 

Once they are done, cut them in half. 

Peel sweet potatoes (with fingers. No peeler needed).

Mash sweet potatoes with fork or masher.

Melt butter in microwave (\~20 sec)

Mix sweet potatoes with butter and brown sugar.

Put marshmallows on top of sweet potato mix.
