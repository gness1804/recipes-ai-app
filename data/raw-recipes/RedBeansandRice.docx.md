Red Beans and Rice

2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 pound fully cooked smoked sausage (such as hot links or Kielbasa), sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds (good with vegan sausage, the tube kind)  
1 onion, chopped  
4 garlic cloves, chopped  
3 cans (15 oz each) kidney beans  
1 cup canned low-salt chicken broth  
1 teaspoon Creole or Cajun seasoning or 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
3 cups cooked rice (can reduce to 2 cups)

Cook the rice.

Divide cooked rice among large shallow soup bowls. Spoon bean mixture over rice and serve.

Heat olive oil in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add sausage, onion and garlic and sauté until onion is brown, about 15 minutes. Mix in kidney beans with their juices, broth and Creole seasoning. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until flavors are blended and mixture is very thick, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes (20-25 min seemed to work well)
