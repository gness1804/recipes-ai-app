Rating: N

## Ingredients

- 0.25 cup plain yogurt
- 0.25 cup lemon juice
- 0.25 cup canola oil
- 3 tablespoons white vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced
- 2 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 0.25 cup canola oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, paprika, cumin, and oregano in a large glass or ceramic bowl; mix well. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
2. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil in batches until tender and browned, about 5 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165°F (74°C).
