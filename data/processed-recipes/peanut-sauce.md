Rating: 9.5/10

## Ingredients

- 0.5 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 0.5 teaspoon ginger
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 0.25 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 0.25 cup water or coconut milk
- Peanuts, broken up into small pieces (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, lime juice, and red pepper flakes.
2. Gradually add water or coconut milk, a little at a time, whisking until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. If you want to spread or dip it, add less water/milk, and for drizzling, add more water/milk.
3. Taste the sauce and adjust the flavors if needed, adding more lime juice, soy sauce, or red pepper flakes to suit your taste.
4. Use immediately as a dip, drizzle, or toss with noodles. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
