# Black bean soup

Rating: 7/10

## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 0.75 cup frozen chopped onions
- 2 cans (15 oz. ea.) black beans
- 1 can (14.5 oz.) fat-free chicken broth
- 1 can (15.25 oz.) corn kernels, drained
- 1 can (14.5 oz.) Mexican-style stewed tomatoes
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 0.5 teaspoon ground cumin

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a 4.5-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until slightly brown, stirring occasionally.
2. Meanwhile, pour 1 can of beans and their liquid into a large cereal bowl. Using the back of a serving-size spoon, mash the beans against the sides and bottom of the bowl until the beans are broken up and pasty.
3. Raise the heat under the pot to high and add the chicken broth, mashed beans, and the can of whole beans and its liquid. Stir well. Drain the corn and add it to the pot, then add the stewed tomatoes, bay leaves, garlic, thyme, vinegar, and cumin. Cover the pot and bring the soup to a boil.
4. Reduce the heat to low and simmer to let the flavors blend, 8 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking. Remove from the heat and serve.
