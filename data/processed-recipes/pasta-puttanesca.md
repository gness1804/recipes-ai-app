# Pasta Puttanesca

Rating: 6.5/10

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 can (2 oz.) anchovies, packed in oil
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 0.5 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 box or can (26 to 28 oz.) chopped or crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- 0.5 cup pitted black olives, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped
- Grated zest of 1 lemon
- 12 oz. spaghetti or other pasta

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, put the olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, add the onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the anchovies and garlic and cook, stirring, until the anchovies disintegrate and the garlic has softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the tomato paste and crushed red pepper and continue to stir for 1 minute, then add the tomatoes, capers, and olives. Cover the pot, adjust the heat so the mixture simmers gently, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it’s thick and saucy, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Stir in the basil and lemon zest, and taste and adjust the seasoning.
5. When the water comes to a boil, salt it generously and add the pasta. Cook until al dente, usually 7 to 8 minutes, depending on the package instructions.
6. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking liquid and then drain the pasta. Toss the pasta with the sauce, adding the reserved cooking liquid as needed to thin out the sauce. Serve hot.
