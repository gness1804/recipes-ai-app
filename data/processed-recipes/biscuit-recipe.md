Rating: N

## Ingredients

- 1.75 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. In a medium-size bowl, mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt with a spoon.
3. Pour in the cream and mix with a spoon until it forms big lumps. Then mix with your hands until it forms a smooth ball.
4. Place the dough on a lightly floured table. Press the dough out with your hands, fold it back onto itself, and press out again. Turn it around and press and fold again for about 1 minute.
5. Roll out the dough to about 0.75 inch thick. Cut into shapes with a cookie cutter or glass.
6. Prepare a baking sheet. Dip each biscuit in melted butter, let excess drip off, and place on the sheet.
7. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until nice and brown.
