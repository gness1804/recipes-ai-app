## Instructions

### Main Dish Instructions
1. Bring 2.5 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice, cover, and remove from heat.
2. Defrost frozen chicken in the microwave for 2 minutes on high; meanwhile, make the Spicy Peanut Sauce (see below).
3. Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat. Cut the chicken into short strips about 1.5 inches wide, adding them to the skillet as you cut.
4. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until the chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. While the chicken cooks, cut the scallions into 0.75-inch slices, using the white and enough of the tender green tops to make 0.75 cup; drain the bamboo shoots, and chop the peanuts. Set each aside.
6. When the chicken is no longer pink, add the scallions, bamboo shoots, peanuts, soy sauce, sherry, and sugar. Stir well, then add the Peanut Sauce and stir well again.
7. Cook until heated through, 2 minutes. Serve over a bed of the rice.
