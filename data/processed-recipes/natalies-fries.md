## Ingredients

- 2 to 3 potatoes
- Fragrant veggies (cilantro, scallions, basil, etc.), chopped
- Olive oil
- Water
- Salt
- Pepper
- Other spices (optional)

## Instructions

1. Peel the potatoes.
2. Cut potatoes into small, evenly cut strips (0.33 to 0.5 inch strips lengthwise).
3. Cut up scallions, basil, or other fragrant green veggies into small pieces. Substitute yellow or white onion for scallions if scallions are not available.
4. Heat olive oil in a pan that has a lid.
5. Put potatoes in hot oil; season potatoes with salt, pepper, and other spices if desired.
6. Add water, only enough to ensure potatoes do not burn.
7. Cook potatoes in oil for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, keeping the lid on during cooking.
8. When cooking is about halfway done, add chopped fragrant greens. Leave greens on top of potatoes; do not stir.
9. When greens have wilted, mix them with potatoes. Keep the lid on as much as possible.
10. Take out of the pan and serve.
