## Ingredients

- 1 cup sweetened, shredded coconut
- 2.5 cups chicken stock or broth
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 0.5 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 cups basil, torn
- Zest and juice of 1 lime

## Instructions

1. Toast coconut in a saucepan over medium heat until it turns golden brown. Reserve 0.5 cup for garnish.
2. To the remaining coconut in the saucepan, add the chicken stock, rice, and salt, and bring it to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, place a lid on top, and cook for 15 minutes. Let the mixture stand for five minutes off the heat, then fluff with a fork.
3. While the rice is cooking, preheat a large, nonstick skillet over high heat with the canola oil. When the pan is hot, add the chicken and brown.
4. Add the red bell peppers, red pepper flakes, and garlic, stirring frequently for about 3-4 minutes.
5. Add the soy sauce and basil and toss to combine. Serve the chicken and some of the sauce over the coconut rice and squeeze some lime juice over everything. Garnish with the reserved toasted coconut and the lime zest.
