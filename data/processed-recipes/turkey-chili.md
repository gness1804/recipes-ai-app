Rating: [MISSING]

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. ground turkey, fresh or frozen
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped (for 1 cup)
- 1 large green bell pepper, chopped (for 1.5 cups)
- 1 cup frozen carrot slices
- 1 can (15.5 oz.) red kidney beans
- 1 can (15 oz.) black beans
- 2 cans (14.5 oz. ea.) chili-style stewed tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 14 oil-cured olives, pitted (optional)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. If the turkey is frozen, run hot water over it so you can remove any packaging. Place the turkey on a microwave-safe plate and microwave 2 minutes, uncovered, on high, to begin defrosting.
2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 4.5-quart Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the pot as you chop. Stir occasionally.
3. Add the turkey (fresh or partially defrosted) to the pot and raise the heat to high. Cook, turning and breaking up the meat from time to time. While the meat cooks, seed and coarsely chop the bell pepper, adding it to the pot as you chop. Add the carrots.
4. While the turkey cooks, rinse and drain both of the beans. Add them to the pot along with the stewed tomatoes, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and olives (if using). Stir well.
5. Cook on high, stirring frequently, until all the meat is crumbled and browned. Reduce the heat to medium and cook about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
