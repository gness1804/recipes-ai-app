# Mashed Sweet Potato Casserole with Pecan & Marshmallow Topping

Rating: 6.5/10

## Ingredients

- 4 lb. sweet potatoes (about 6 large ones)
- 0.5 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the dish
- 0.25 cup brown sugar
- 0.25 cup pure maple syrup
- 0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 0.25 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 0.25 cup heavy cream or whole milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Salt, to taste
- 1 cup pecans, chopped
- 1-2 cups mini marshmallows

## Instructions

### To do the night before:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pierce the sweet potatoes several times with a fork and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake until they are soft, about 1 hour. Remove them from the oven and let cool slightly.
2. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and place the flesh in a large mixing bowl. Then put the peeled potatoes in the fridge overnight.

### To do the day of:

1. Add the butter and mash the potatoes until they’re smooth. You can use a potato masher or hand mixer to get a creamier consistency.
2. Stir in the brown sugar, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, heavy cream, and vanilla extract into the mashed sweet potatoes. Season with salt to your taste.
3. Butter a medium-size baking dish. Transfer the sweet potato mixture to the dish, smoothing the top with a spatula.
4. In a small bowl, mix the chopped pecans with a bit of butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar if desired for extra crunch and sweetness. Sprinkle this mixture over the mashed sweet potatoes.
5. Arrange the mini marshmallows over the top of the pecans, covering the surface.
6. Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes (at the same temperature of 375°F (190°C)), or until the marshmallows are golden brown and puffy. Keep a close eye on it towards the end to prevent the marshmallows from burning.
7. Let the casserole sit for a few minutes after taking it out of the oven; this will allow the topping to set slightly. Serve warm.
