## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil or margarine
- 1 medium onion (0.75 cup), chopped
- 8 oz. turkey kielbasa sausage
- 1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic
- 1.75 cups instant rice
- 1 can (14.5 oz.) fat-free chicken broth
- 0.25 cup white wine
- 0.5 teaspoon onion powder
- 0.25 teaspoon dried oregano
- 0.25 teaspoon dried thyme
- 0.25 teaspoon black pepper
- Ground cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce, to taste (optional)
- 1 can (15 oz.) white beans, such as Great Northern
- 1 can (15 oz.) black beans
- 1 can (14.5 oz.) stewed tomatoes
- 0.5 cup frozen small shrimp

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a lid. Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the skillet as you chop. Cut the sausage into 0.25-inch-thick slices, adding them to the skillet as you slice.
2. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the garlic, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the rice, chicken broth, and wine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine the onion powder, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) in a small bowl or cup. Drain and rinse both of the beans.
4. Add the spice mixture to the skillet and stir. Stir in the beans, stewed tomatoes, and shrimp.
