Rating: [MISSING]

## Ingredients

- 2.5 cups instant (5-minute) rice
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped (1 cup)
- 1 can (15.5 oz.) red beans, drained
- 1 can (15.5 oz.) white beans, drained
- 1 can (2.25 oz.) pitted sliced black olives (optional)
- 1 can (15 oz.) black beans
- 2 cans (14.5 oz. ea.) salsa-style diced tomatoes
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Bring 2.5 cups water to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Meanwhile, begin step 2. When the water boils, add the rice, cover the pan, and remove from the heat until ready to serve.

2. Heat the oil over medium heat in an extra-deep nonstick 12-inch skillet that has a lid. Peel and coarsely chop the onion, adding it to the skillet as you chop. Let cook while you drain the red and white beans and the olives (if using).

3. Raise the heat to high and add the drained beans and olives, the black beans with their liquid, tomatoes, corn, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Stir well to mix. Cover the skillet and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, uncover, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes more. Stir occasionally.

4. Lower the heat to a simmer and sprinkle the cheese over the bean mixture. Cover and cook until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the beans over a bed of the rice.
