# Sweet Potato & Potato Curry (Rataru ne Bateta nu Shak)

Rating: 5/10

## Ingredients

- 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup crushed tomatoes
- 3-4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 dried red chilli (optional)
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin-coriander (dhana jiru)
- 1 teaspoon salt, adjust to taste
- 1 teaspoon chilli powder, use less or omit for mild heat
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons tamarind sauce (optional)
- 2 teaspoons jaggery or brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons sunflower oil (or olive/other neutral oil)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the vegetables.** Peel and cube the sweet potato and potatoes; rinse them in cold water.
2. **Bloom the spices.** Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and add the dried chilli and mustard seeds until the seeds pop.
3. **Cook the potatoes.** Add the cubed potatoes to the pan with salt, turmeric, chilli powder, and cumin-coriander. Add the crushed garlic and stir so the spices coat the potatoes. Pour in 1 cup of water and simmer until the potatoes start to soften.
4. **Add sweet potatoes.** Add the cubed sweet potatoes (they cook faster than regular potatoes) and continue cooking gently until both types of potato are tender but not mushy.
5. **Add acidity and sweetness.** Stir in crushed tomatoes, lemon juice, tamarind (if using), and jaggery/brown sugar. Cook a couple more minutes so the flavors meld.
6. **Serve.** Adjust seasoning, garnish with fresh cilantro if you have it, and serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.
