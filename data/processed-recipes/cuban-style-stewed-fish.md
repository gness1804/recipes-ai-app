# Cuban-Style Stewed Fish

Rating: [MISSING]

## Ingredients

- 4 packs (4 oz. ea.) tilapia
- 1 lemon, divided use
- 0.25 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Cuban seasoning blend
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup chopped yellow or orange bell pepper
- 1 cup chopped fresh tomato
- 0.5 cup dry white wine
- Chopped parsley, optional garnish
- Cooked rice of choice, optional

## Instructions

1. Rinse and dry each fillet. Place on a plate and squirt juice from one half lemon over the fillets, turning to coat well.
2. In a large zipper top bag, combine flour and 1 tablespoon of seasoning. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place each fillet individually in the bag and shake to coat with flour mixture, placing into skillet. Repeat until all the fillets are in the skillet. Discard remaining flour mixture. Fry fillets on each side until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes each. Remove to a plate.
3. Add onion, pepper, and tomatoes to hot skillet. (There should still be a bit of oil in the skillet, if not add a few teaspoons.) Stir and cook vegetables until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add remaining juice from lemon half, remaining Cuban seasoning (1 teaspoon), and wine. Reduce heat to low. Place fillets back in skillet over vegetables and cover skillet. Stew for 5 minutes to allow fish to heat and absorb flavors from the vegetables and juices. Serve over rice of choice and garnish with parsley, if desired.
