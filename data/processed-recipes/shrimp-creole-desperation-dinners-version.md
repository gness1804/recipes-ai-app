# Shrimp Creole Desperation Dinners Version

Rating: 6/10

## Ingredients

- 1 to 2 cups brown rice
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 medium ribs celery, chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (or soy sauce)
- 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced or 2 teaspoons bottled minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay (or Cajun seasoning)
- 1 bay leaf
- 0.5 teaspoon dried thyme
- 0.25 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 dash Tabasco sauce, or more to taste
- 1 can diced tomatoes, seasoned with onions and garlic
- 1 small can (8 oz.) tomato sauce
- 1 lb. already-cooked, already-peeled shrimp, fresh or frozen

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Add the onion, celery, and bell pepper. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables begin to get tender, about 2 minutes. While the vegetables cook, begin adding the Worcestershire sauce, garlic, Cajun seasoning, bay leaf, thyme, black pepper, and Tabasco sauce.
2. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the tomato sauce, and stir well. Raise the heat to medium-high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Meanwhile, continue adding the remaining spices. Continue to cook the sauce at a moderate boil for 2 minutes to blend the flavors.
3. Stir in the shrimp, and cook, stirring frequently, until they are heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes if the shrimp are frozen, and about 2 minutes if not frozen. Taste the sauce, and add more Tabasco sauce if desired. Serve at once over hot, cooked rice, if desired.
